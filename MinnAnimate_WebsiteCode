<h1>About</h1>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Founded in 2012 by then Minneapolis-based animator John Akre, MinnAnimate has manifested primarily as a single-screening animation festival. From 2020-2021, the festival went on hiatus, returning in 2022 under the leadership of CC Stanhill. In 2024, the torch was passed to Merit Thursday and Adam Loomis who co-organize it today.</p>
